## 🗓️ Wednesday Submission & Fortnightly Bulletin Workflow

This calendar includes a dedicated, streamlined workflow tailored to Cork City Partnership's bi-weekly event circulation schedule:

### 1. Wednesday Afternoon: Staff Submissions
- **Direct Submission URL:** `https://<your-domain>/submit` (or `/?mode=submit`)
- **No Password Required:** All CCP staff can open the link directly on desktop or mobile.
- **Fields:** Event Name, Category, Date & Time, Venue/Location, Short Description, Poster/Flyer upload, Submitter Name & Email.
- Submitted events are automatically queued in the database with status `draft` (Pending Review).

### 2. Thursday: Admin Review & Moderation
- Admins (Elizabeth, Igor, etc.) log into the calendar.
- The **Navbar** shows an active notification badge: `[📥 Submissions (3)]`.
- Click **Submissions** to open the review panel:
  - Inspect submitter info, date/time, venue, description, and full poster preview.
  - **Approve & Publish:** Sets status to `published` in 1 click; event immediately appears on the calendar.
  - **Edit:** Adjust details or formatting before approving.
  - **Approve All:** Batch approve all verified submissions.

### 3. Friday Morning: Fortnightly Bulletin (PDF & WhatsApp)
- Click the **"Bulletin"** button in the Navbar or in the **Export** dialog.
- Select the 14-day date range (defaults to next 2 weeks).
- Choose layout style:
  - **Executive Digest:** A4 visual cards with category pills, date/time badges, descriptions, and embedded flyer thumbnails. Ideal for the Board of Directors.
  - **Compact Table:** Dense agenda table.
- Click **Download Fortnightly PDF Bulletin** to generate the document with official Cork City Partnership colors (`#B30066` and `#39B54A`) and logo.
- Click **Copy WhatsApp Summary** to copy a preformatted markdown text with emojis ready to paste directly into company WhatsApp groups.

### Database Setup
To enable anonymous draft submissions in Supabase, execute `submission-migration.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (Auth + Database)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) project (optional for local dev)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihorvasyliev-gh/CCPFlowCalendar.git
cd CCPFlowCalendar
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run `supabase-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor. Then apply migrations if needed:

- `event-comments-occurrence-migration.sql`
- `rsvp-occurrence-migration.sql`
- `recurrence-exceptions-migration.sql`
- `custom-dates-migration.sql`
- `fix-category-constraint.sql`

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

### Build Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Root directory | `/` |

### Environment Variables (Cloudflare Pages Dashboard)

Set in **Pages → Settings → Environment Variables**:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous/public key |
| `VITE_CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL` | R2 public URL for file serving |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Same as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — used by Pages Functions |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Same as `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — used by Pages Functions |

> **Note:** `VITE_*` variables are injected at build time by Vite. `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (without `VITE_` prefix) are required at runtime by Cloudflare Pages Functions (e.g. the ICS calendar feed).

### R2 Bucket

Bind an R2 bucket named `BUCKET` in **Pages → Settings → Functions → R2 Bucket Bindings** for file uploads.

See `DEPLOY.md` and `CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## Cloudflare Pages Functions

Server-side endpoints powered by [Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/):

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/upload` | `PUT` | Upload files to R2 (posters, attachments) |
| `/api/file/:key` | `GET` | Serve files from R2 |
| `/api/calendar` | `GET` | Live ICS calendar feed for subscription |

### Calendar Subscription (ICS Feed)

The `/api/calendar` endpoint returns a live RFC 5545 ICS feed of all published events (with recurring expansion). Calendar apps auto-refresh every ~6 hours.

**How to subscribe:**

- **Outlook:** Add Calendar → From Internet → paste `https://your-site.pages.dev/api/calendar`
- **Google Calendar:** Other calendars (+) → From URL → paste URL
- **Apple Calendar:** File → New Calendar Subscription → paste URL
- **In-app:** Open Export & Subscribe modal → Subscribe tab → Copy URL or click "Open in Calendar App"

## Creating an Admin User

New sign-ups default to **staff**. To promote a user to admin, update the `role` column in the `public.users` table:

```sql
UPDATE public.users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

See `CREATE_ADMIN_USER.md` for detailed instructions.
